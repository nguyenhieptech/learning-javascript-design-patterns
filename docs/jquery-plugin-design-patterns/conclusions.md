# Conclusions

In this chapter, we explored several time-saving design patterns and best practices that can be employed to improve how jQuery plugins can be written. Some are better suited to certain use cases than others, but I hope on the whole these patterns are useful.

Remember, when selecting a pattern, it is important to be practical. Don’t use a plugin pattern just for the sake of it, rather, invest time in understanding the underlying structure, and establish how well it solves your problem or fits the component you’re trying to build.
