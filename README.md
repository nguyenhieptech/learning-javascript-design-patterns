## Why I made this?

I find it quite uncomfortable to read the book with light mode - it just doesn't fit my eyes. So, I take the content of the book and make a static site with dark mode support. If you're here to learn Javascript, feel free to use it on your own.

### Update

The original source has a brand new UI look, which is so much better than it was, but still doesn't support dark mode.
